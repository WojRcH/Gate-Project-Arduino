# Gate-Project-Arduino
Simple Arduino project using RFID module, servo and RGB LED.

# Goal
Main goal of the project was to create working car gate that can open using RFID module.
If right token is used gate is opening, RGB LED changes green, and passive buzzer does sound. If wrong token is used RGB LED blinks red and gate won't open.
There is also a message in serial with card code and information about access.
